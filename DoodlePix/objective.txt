DoodlePix is a app that allows you to draw on a canvas and generate images from your drawings.
So the user will draw on the left, click a button and generate and visualize the image on the right.

Structure
"drawing" viewport on the left 
"generating" viewport on the right

All the buttons must have icons and when hovered, a tooltip must appear with the button name


The drawing viewport must be solid black before i draw on it.

On the Drawing viewport, in a column on the left, there is a list of buttons
1- draw or erase button (on draws, off erases) (the drawing line must always be white)
2- color picker button (opens a color picker and a color wheel to choose the color i want to draw the shape with)
3- Drawing shape button draws a lasso and fills it with the active color in the color picker
4- undo button (undoes the last action)
5- redo button (redoes the last action)
6- clear button (clears the drawing)
7- save button (saves the drawing)
8- brush settings (opens the brush settings menu, in which we can change texture, size, hardness, opacity etc...)


In Between the drawing viewport and the generating viewport, there is a button to generate the image.
and two buttons underneath to go back to the previous and next image in the history of the generated images.

On the right side, in the generating viewport in the right corner on the side of the generated image
1- a browse button to browse in the local foders to find the path of the model
2- a text box for the prompt
3- a choice list to select the scheduler
3- various sliders for the steps, guidance scale, seed based on the inference
4- a bool to Reload the new pipeline, or use the previous one during generation. so that i dont have to reload it each time.
