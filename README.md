# Piethon
These are some apps that I´ve developed to quicken some boring workflows or to better handle large loads of manual work.

Feel free to check it out and grab what u need. 

Keep in mind that all of these are tailor-suited to my needs of the time, so they might very well be useless to you unless you happen to be in the same circumstances as I was.

# Requirements

pip install -r requirements.txt
